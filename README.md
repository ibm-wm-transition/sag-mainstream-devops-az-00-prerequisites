This repository provides a set of convenient scripts that you can use to prepare Azure Cloud compute resources to support the mainstream DevOps pipelines used in the `sag-mainstream-devops-az-*` repositories.

## Azure Resources

### Quick Start with Cloud Shell

#### Prerequisites

- A valid Azure user
- A valid Azure service principal, identified with a secret
- A Resource Group where you are owner
  - If you have access to a subscription where you are owner you can create the resource group and assign the relevant permissions to the resource group
  - If you only have access to the resource group, ask the subscription owner to assign the contributor role to the service principal on the resource group
- Browser access to Azure resources via [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
- Clone this repository on your PC

#### Operations

##### Option 1: Bash cloud shell with mount of the cloud share

- Open a browser to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
- Open a cloud shell with "bash"
  - If this is the first time you open a cloud shell associate a storage account and a share to it
    - You may create the storage account inside the given resource group if you do not have other options
- Follow the instructions in Azure on how to mount the share on your local pc
  - Example: [how to mount the share on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-how-to-use-files-windows)
  - Example: [how to mount the share on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-how-to-use-files-linux?tabs=smb311)
- Copy the folder "bash" of this repository onto the share in a convenient location (e.g. `z:\az-pipe-prerequisites\bash`)
- Inside the above folder copy `setEnvExample.sh` into `setEnv.sh`
- Edit `setEnv.sh` and set the values of your environment
  - If you do not know the App ID of your service principal, use the following command to obtain it
    - `az ad sp list --display-name "DevOps - TrainingSP - 9" -o table`
- Execute the shell scripts in the given order (00 to 11) or use directly the more convenient `createAll.sh`
- Eventually execute `98.produceEnvForDev.sh`. Copy the three "export" resulting lines into a private file on your PC. These lines will be saved in a secure file in the DevOps project.

##### Option 2: Bash cloud shell without mounting the cloud share

- Open a browser to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
- Open a cloud shell with "bash".
- Clone this repository into a folder of your choice.

    ![cloud shell bash git clone](./imgs/cloudshellbashgitclone.png)

    ```bash
    cd clouddrive
    git clone -b main --depth 1 https://github.com/SoftwareAG/sag-mainstream-devops-az-00-prerequisites.git
    cd sag-mainstream-devops-az-00-prerequisites
    ```

- Navigate to folder "bash" and copy the file ```setEnvExample.sh``` into ```setEnv.sh```

    ```bash
    cd bash
    cp setEnvExample.sh setEnv.sh
    ```

- Edit ```setEnv.sh``` and set the values as per your environment

    ```bash
    vi setEnv.sh
    ```
    **Note:** Watch the naming constraints, e.g. SA names must be max 24 chars long and lowercase. Keep the MY_PREFIX short, lowercase and without special characters. Eventually shorten the names that concatenate it.

- Execute the shell scripts in the given order (00 to 11) or use directly the more convenient ```createAll.sh```. Verify the file permissions before executing it.
- Eventually execute ```98.produceEnvForDev.sh```. Copy the three "export" resulting lines into a private file on your PC. These lines will be saved in a secure file in the DevOps project.

```NOTE: Azure Cloud Shell comes with folder "clouddrive" by default. After executing "00.assureLocalSshKeys.sh" verify link is created for folder "clouddrive/.ssh"```

#### Other Options

**TODO**: other options are easily available, they will be documented if necessary

## Secure files

In the `secureFiles` subfolder you will find examples of the files that will be required to be uploaded into the Azure DevOps project.

- Copy every `example.*.sh` into `*.sh` (i.e. remove the "Example." prefix from the name)
- Edit the files and declare your own environment specific keys.
- Upload the files in the Pipelines->Library->Secure files section maintaining the names. These names are referred to in the provided `azure-pipeline.yml` files.
- When the time comes, i.e. when you will have the actual pipelines, grant the permissions as follows:
  - `sdc.credentials.sh` is used to access Software AG Empower Download Center (aka "SDC") and is only used in the first pipeline
  - `sa.share.secrets.sh` is used to access the storage account where the product and fixes zip files are stored and is in the first two pipelines
    - the contents of this file may be obtained from cloud shell with the script `98.produceEnvForDev.sh`
  - `acr.sp.credentials.sh` is used to access the Azure Container Registry (ACR) in all pipelines besides the first one
- specific license files will also be uploaded as secure files, but they will depend on the contents of the pipelines. `msr-license.xml` will likely be always used
